# rock_paper_scissors

### by Ron Craig

## Generate the game rock, paper, scissors using Ruby, Gem & BBD coding

## Write a method to handle the different combination of plays and to write specs for all possible combination of plays.

## After all specs are passing, build a script a player can run to play the game (two player game or play against the computer).
